# Email tool reference

## Read-only

- `list_threads`, `search_threads`, `get_thread`
- `list_messages`, `search_messages`, `get_message`
- `list_drafts`, `get_draft`
- `get_attachment`

## Private writes

- `update_thread` and `update_message` add or remove labels.

## External or potentially irreversible writes

- `send_message`, `reply_to_message`, `forward_message`, and `send_draft` contact external recipients.
- `create_draft` and `update_draft` can schedule delivery when `sendAt` is present.
- `delete_thread` deletes every message in the thread.
- `delete_draft` also cancels scheduled delivery.

## Invariants

- Use opaque IDs returned by AgentMailer; never guess resource IDs.
- Use the complete thread before drafting a context-dependent reply.
- Keep credentials, authorization headers, and raw tokens out of prompts and tool output.
- Do not retry an ambiguous send with a new idempotency key. First inspect state, then retry the same logical action with the original key if needed.
- Respect authorization errors; do not probe other organizations or inboxes.
